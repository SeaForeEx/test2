This is line 1.
This is line 2.
This is not line 4.
This is not line 3.

I used to work at O'Reilly Auto Parts.  My old boss was terrified of the number 666.  When we were setting up the store, there was a part he was supposed to put on the shelf.  The part number was MKD666 and he did not want to touch it.  So he told me to put it on the shelf for him.  Anyway, this is line 6.
And on the seventh line he rested.
What a crock o' sh!t.
English is a fun language.
